# kotlin-spark-routes
Playground for combining kotlin-spark, Thymleaf, custom annotations etc

This is where I play around with Kotlin, kotlin-sparkjava, and other technologies. I'm hoping that this repository will at least compile, if not actually do anything useful.

A running version of the app _may_ be found [hosted on Heroku](https://kotlin-spark-routes.herokuapp.com/users).
